# Code Structure

All code in **Elijjah** lives in functions. Functions can only reside in namespaces or classes.

Classes and namespaces live in a module, alongside other elements.

A module is basically a file, and the name of a module (the file name), has no bearing on the semantics of the program.

Files, of course, live in directories, alongside other files (and at times directories), and these directories are called libraries.

A (any number of) library plus a main module creates an executable.

A program can be distibuted as an executable, a library or a shared library in the traditional understanding of the words.
